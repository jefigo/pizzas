# Pizzas

The Ruby file `pizzas.rb` contains a method to find all the combinations of ingredients for a pizza given a list of ingredients. It also includes a test case using RSpec.

You can either test the code in the Ruby console by passing as argument a list of ingredients or run the test with RSpec `rspec pizzas.rb`
